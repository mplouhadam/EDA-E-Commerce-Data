## Project
This project aims to answer my curiosity about product performance and behavior customer in UK, including:
- What products sell the most? 
- What products profit the most?
- What products that have negative response (get refund by frequency)?
- How much is the average purchase in a day?
- Who (customers) buys the most?
- When do customers usually buy the product?
